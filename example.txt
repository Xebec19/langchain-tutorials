On the edge of a remote coastal town stood an old lighthouse, its towering structure casting a long shadow over the rocky cliffs. 
The townsfolk rarely spoke about it, except in hushed whispers, as if afraid of awakening something within. 
Many believed the lighthouse had been abandoned for decades, yet on stormy nights, a dim light flickered from its highest window.

One evening, young Riya, an aspiring journalist, decided to uncover the truth. 
Armed with a flashlight and a notebook, she made her way up the winding path leading to the lighthouse. 
The wooden door, surprisingly unlocked, creaked open at her touch. 
Dust swirled in the air as she stepped inside, revealing a spiral staircase that seemed to disappear into the darkness above.

As she climbed, she noticed faded paintings on the wallsâ€”portraits of a man in a navy uniform. 
At the top, she found a small room filled with old books and a single chair facing the sea. 
A lantern flickered beside it. 
Just as she was about to leave, she heard footsteps echoing from below. 
Her heart pounded. Was she truly alone?
